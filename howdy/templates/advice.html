<h4>As upperclassmen in high school, we can answer almost any question related to preparing for college, how to spend your time effectively, and much more. The simple act of showing an interest in different opportunities is the first step on your path to success!</h4>

<br>
      <h1>SAT and ACT- Different ways to get ready!
</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> SAT! ACT! The two most important tests considered on your college applications. No pressure!  There are many ways to prepare for the SAT and/or ACT, but it is first important to know which one is right for you. Let’s talk about these two tests, in detail.
        <br>
        <h3>SAT</h3><h5>The SAT contains 4 mandatory sections: reading, writing, math with no calculator, and math with a calculator, along with an optional essay. You will get a combined score out of 800 for the two math sections, and the reading and writing sections. Therefore, the new SAT is out of 1600 points. You have 3 hours total for the test, excluding the 50 minute optional essay. Specifically, you are given 65 minutes to answer 52 multiple choice questions in the reading section, 35 minutes to answer 44 multiple choice questions in the writing section, 55 minutes to answer 25 multiple choice questions and 13 student-produced responses in the math section with a calculator, and 25 minutes to answer 15 multiple choice questions and 5 student-produced reponses in the math section without a calculator. This section includes the following topics: algebra, problem solving and data analysis, and advanced math. For the essay, you will read a passage, and identify literary devices used by the author that help prove their argument.</h5>
<br>
        <br>
        <h3>ACT</h3><h5>The ACT is completely different, since the scoring ranges from 1 to 36. There 4 sections of the ACT, excluding the optional essay: english, math, reading, and science. The english section contains 75 questions, and you are given just 45 minutes finish. For the math section, you are allowed to use a calculator at all times, and must answer 60 multiple choice questions in one hour. The reading and science sections both contain
40 multiple choice questions, and you are given 35 minutes to complete each one.</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Studying?</h3><h5>
Your preparation for these standardized tests really depends on how you learn best. You could study on your own through an online course, pay for classes, buy an SAT or ACT book, and/or get a private tutor.
<br>
<br>
Okay, should I take SAT or ACT?
<br><br>
Before you start studying, you should take practice tests for both to see which one you prefer! This will save you money, time, and enegry. While the SAT questions are described as more puzzling and deceiving, the ACT questions are known to be more straightforward. However, the ACT has a much quicker pace, and is recommended mainly for students who are fast readers and are interested in science.
<br><br>
Should I take more than one SAT/ACT?
<br><br>
Unless you get an amazing score on your first try, yes! There is almost always room for improvement, especially if you change up your study methods. The more you practice, the more comfortable you will be with the format. It’s scientifically proven that most students perform better when they retake the test! Also, The College Board, or the organization that administers the SAT, is partnered with Khan Academy, which helps students study by offering practice in the areas you need the most help in. Simply link your College Board account with Khan Academy!</h5>

      <h1>College Applications</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        <h3>What should you be doing?<h3>
      <h5> Many students realize too late that colleges don’t just look at your GPA, test scores, and classes, but also at the extracurricular activities you participate in. Therefore, it’s very important that you get involved in school clubs, sports, outside organizations, or that you pick up a hobby before you get to senior year! But first, pay attention to one very important thing: if you’re doing something for the sole purpose of putting it on your college applications, stop! Another part of applying to college is answering prompts (short essay questions), which often ask about your passions. If all you’ve been doing has been something you actually hate, it will be hard to convey your “passions, ” and you will most likely have dedicated a lot of time to something you don’t even enjoy.</h5>
<br>
<h5>So what can you do? First, try looking around your school. Are there any clubs that sound interesting, or that your friends are a part of? A good leadership experience would definitely be holding an officer position one day, so join soon! Another thing colleges like to see is commitment. If there’s a sport you enjoy, stick to it!
Next, start looking outside of school. Find an organization you can volunteer with on a regular basis. If you need ideas, check out our volunteering page!<h5>
<br>
<h5>It’s also a good idea to spend your summers wisely. Definitely get away and clear your mind, but also think about summer programs, and how you can make your break meaningful. Check out our internships page to get some ideas of what you could do! Summer is also a great time to make some money. Especially if you’re 16, start looking at shops close to home, or any place you think could use your help. Work experience is a really good thing to have under your belt - and babysitting is always an option! Another great, but less enticing activity you could do over the summer, is take classes. If there’s a class your high school doesn’t offer, but local community college does, take the opportunity! Or, if there’s a requirement you need filled, summer is a great time to get it over with. I have also known many people to take the next highest math class over the summer, and come back the next year a whole math class ahead! It may not seem like the most fun, but you’ll thank yourself later. And as a high schooler, enrolling in a community college course is free. </h5>
<br>
<h3>Getting started on the application</h3><h5>
Here are the first couple prompts on the University of California application, which have a maximum of 350 words:
